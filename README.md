but much better, [THIS](https://github.com/akullpp/awesome-java#cli) is what you want.

## Description

Have you ever wanted to just quickly write a tool in java that didn't need a fancy GUI,
but you also didn't feel like writing all the code for verifying inputs and menus
for the 100th time?

Well so did I.

This library is quite lightweight, has no dependencies, and is very simple to use.

Some of the features included are:
