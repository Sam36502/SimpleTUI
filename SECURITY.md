## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have found a security vulnerability,
thank you. I have no patience to search for
these things, but I also don't want to make
an insecure library. (Even if nobody uses it...)

To report a vulnerability send me an
email at sam@aepearce.com describing what the
issue is. I don't think that many people will
end up using this, and I don't think there'll
be many security holes, so unless there's a 
sudden uptick in users, this manual system will do.

Thanks again for your help.
