# Contributing to SimpleTUI

## Introduction
To begin with, thank you for checking out my library,
and thanks for reading the contribution guidelines.
These guidelines are broken down into different
sections based on how you might want to contribute.

Here is a table of contents to help you navigate:
- ["I found a bug"](#i-found-a-bug)
- ["I want a new feature"](#i-want-a-new-feature)
- ["I want to contribute to the wiki"](#i-want-to-contribute-to-the-wiki)
- ["I want to contribute code"](#i-want-to-contribute-code)

## I found a bug!
Great! I don't doubt that this is still pretty buggy, I
haven't spent much time testing it. If you feel like it,
you could review the problematic code and try to fix it
yourself. I will always be grateful of help maintaining
this. See ["I want to contribute code"](#i-want-to-contribute-code) to see how to directly
contribute.

If you don't feel like it or don't have time, that
is no problem. Simply submit a bug report, and I'll get
to fixing it as soon as I can. Make sure to search through
the issues page first to see if it has already been reported.

To make a new bug report go to the [issues](https://github.com/Sam36502/SimpleTUI/issues)
page and create a new issue. Then select bug-report and
fill in the requested information.

## I want a new feature!
Fantastic! Although the project began as a simple text
user interface, it soon branched out into more basic
helpful and common functions. I'm always looking for
cool new features to add. If you know how to create the
feature you desire, see ["I want to contribute code"](#i-want-to-contribute-code) for
more information on directly contributing code.

Otherwise,
you can open a feature request under the [issues](https://github.com/Sam36502/SimpleTUI/issues)
page. Click on "New Issue" and select "feature request".
If I think the feature fits with the theme of SimpleTUI
and it isn't too difficult to implement, it will be added
to the backlog of features to add for the next version.

## I want to contribute to the wiki!
Wonderful! I've had difficulties finding the time to
update the wiki and any help maintaining it, is greatly
appreciated.

If you see a mistake in the wiki that should
be fixed or you would like something to be explained in
more depth, you can open a wiki change request on the [issues](https://github.com/Sam36502/SimpleTUI/issues)
page. Create a new issue and select the wiki request template.
Then just fill out the required information. I will review the
request and decide whether or not it should be implemented.

## I want to contribute code!
Magnificent! I did begin writing this library after only
a year of learning java, so I'm sure there are improvements
to be made *everywhere*. If you would like to fix a bug or
implement your own feature, etc. then you can create a pull
request.

A few things to note about contributing code:
 - If your submission only changes the code style or some other basic formatting,
 it will only be accepted if you can provide a formal style guide. The whole library
 should follow a consistant style.
 - Small changes are more likely to be accepted.
 - Anything that is discovered to introduce a security flaw, will be immediately denied.
 - At the moment the code doesn't adhere to any style guide. Just try to keep consistent
 with the rest of the code.
